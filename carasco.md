The transactions that triggered the structured cash deposit alert were:
- 18-Mar-2025 — cash deposit $7,450
- 19-Mar-2025 — cash deposit $7,500

These two single cash deposits occurred on consecutive days with no other back-to-back cash deposits during the reviewed timeframe. 
Neither date involved splitting deposits into smaller amounts. Additionally, these deposits directly funded two transfers made on 20-Mar-2025 into separate certificate-of-deposit accounts: 
one for $10,000 and another for $5,000. This demonstrates straightforward and transparent use of funds, providing no indication of structuring or attempts to conceal activity.


The transactions that triggered the large ATM cash deposit alert were:
- 07-Apr-2025 — ATM cash deposit $4,770
- 16-May-2025 — ATM cash deposit $3,599
- 22-May-2025 — ATM cash deposit $4,860
- 22-May-2025 — ATM cash deposit $2,060
- 30-May-2025 — ATM cash deposit $5,040
- 12-Jun-2025 — ATM cash deposit $7,090

These deposits represent moderate individual amounts spread out over a relatively long period and are not egregious. The 7 April deposit directly 
funded an ACH loan payment to Pentagon Federal Credit Union (https://www.penfed.org), a known lender, demonstrating legitimate usage. The remaining deposits similarly supported regular account 
obligations and discretionary spending. With clear uses for typical, ordinary purposes, no evidence of rapid cycling or layering exists, confirming the transactions are non-suspicious. Moreover, internal records indicate that Arati Singh's occupation is a laborer with a stated employer of USPS. There are payroll ACH credits in the account but they are 
small, e.g., $200 on 4/25/2025, indicating that the Singh likley also provides labor services outside USPS. It is common for a laborer to be paid in cash.


A sampling of inflows and outflows further supports the non-suspicious nature of this account. Inflows primarily consist of cash deposits, such as $2,260 on 03-Feb-2025, 
and ACH payroll deposits, including $214 from Inova Health System on 13-Jun-2025. These inflows directly fund routine expenses. Outflows mainly include discretionary ACH purchases, 
such as the $5,619 payment to American Express on 09-Jun-2025 and the $37 payment to Farmers Insurance on 16-Jun-2025. The consistent link between inflows and ordinary household expenditures 
further confirms the legitimate nature of the account’s activity. All in all, the non-recurring nature of the structured deposits and the normal use of funds renders the account activity nonsuspcious. There is no evidence of suspicious activity or common tactics associated with structuring, 
such as rapid cycling, layering, or attempts to conceal transactions.
