An internal investigation was completed regarding cash deposit activity on the customer’s account, and --no Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) will be filed--.

The investigation focused on two general alert types: structured cash withdrawals occurring on consecutive days, and cash withdrawals made at ATMs located in a high-risk country (HRC).

Specifically, the transactions reviewed included:

- March 11, 2025: $3,500 cash withdrawal (branch/ATM location not specified)
- March 12, 2025: $8,000 cash withdrawal (branch/ATM location not specified)
- May 9, 2025: $553 cash withdrawal (Atmosphere ATM, Mexico)
- May 15, 2025: $553 cash withdrawal (Atmosphere ATM, Mexico)
- May 21, 2025: $559 cash withdrawal (Atmosphere ATM, Mexico)

The review determined the activity was consistent with normal account behavior. The two consecutive withdrawals in March represented the only instance during the review period in which withdrawals aggregated significantly over a brief timeframe, and no other similar patterns appeared. The ATM withdrawals conducted in Mexico reflect routine cash usage consistent with the customer's known patterns and the general cash-based environment in that country. Additionally, the account holder is a Mexican citizen, making frequent cash usage typical and expected.

There were legitimate cash needs at or near the ATM withdrawal locations. For example, the Club de Golf Malanquín in San Miguel de Allende typically requires cash payments for caddie services and cart fees. Similarly, Plaza Cibeles in Irapuato regularly hosts retail events and craft markets, where many vendors conduct transactions exclusively in cash.

Further supporting the legitimacy of the account’s activity, inflows primarily comprised ACH deposits from Social Security and occasional person-to-person (P2P) payments from individuals. Examples included:

- ACH deposits from Social Security in April and May 2025
- A P2P payment received from an individual in February 2025

Typical outflows consisted primarily of routine cash withdrawals and miscellaneous debit-card transactions, reflecting everyday personal spending habits. Examples included cash withdrawals in February 2025, and ordinary purchases such as restaurant meals and transportation services.

Based on the review, the cash withdrawal activity aligns with the customer’s typical transaction patterns, and there are no indications of suspicious activity. Therefore, a Suspicious Activity Report is not warranted.
