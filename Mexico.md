The review determined the activity was consistent with normal account behavior. The two consecutive withdrawals in March represented the only instance during the review period in which cash transactions aggregated above the regulatory reporting threshold, and no other similar patterns appeared. The ATM withdrawals conducted in Mexico reflect routine cash usage consistent with the customer spending habits. Both account holders are Mexican citizens, making frequent cash usage typical in the country expected. More specifically, one of the locations where cash is typically withdran—Club de Golf Malanquín in San Miguel de Allende—is likley to involve cash for such things as caddie services and cart fees. Similarly, Plaza Cibeles in Irapuato is likely to have many vendors who conduct transactions largely in cash.

Further supporting the legitimacy of the account’s activity, inflows primarily comprised ACH deposits from Social Security and occasional person-to-person (P2P) payments from individuals. Examples included ACH credits from Social Security for $2,022 on 4/23/2025 and 3/26/2025 as well as P2P payments, such as that recieved from Vasilis Tsangarides for $3,500 on 2/28/2025. Typical outflows consisted primarily of routine cash withdrawals and miscellaneous debit-card transactions, reflecting everyday personal spending habits. Examples included cash withdrawals of $527 on 3/28/2025 at Club de Golf S Ma Guanajuato, and ordinary purchases via debit card such as $44 on 5/6/2025 to Apple. Based on the review, the cash withdrawal activity aligns with the customer’s typical transaction patterns, and there are no strong pattern of structuring present.
