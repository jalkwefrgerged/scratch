Narrative (monitoring window — 1 Jan – 31 Mar 2025)

During the quarter AML monitoring generated three alert categories for the relationship: (i) ATM-large-deposit alerts when a single ATM cash credit exceeded $3,000, (ii) large-cash-deposit alerts when a cash credit stood well above prior levels, and (iii) structuring alerts when multiple sub-$10 k cash credits posted close together.



Alerting cash credits

* 31 Jan 2025 – $6,600 ATM cash deposit to the operating account → ATM-large-deposit alert
* 3 Feb 2025 – $9,600 Teller cash deposit → large-cash-deposit alert
* 7 Feb 2025 – $1,500 Teller cash deposit, bringing that week’s aggregate above threshold → large-cash-deposit alert
* 17 Mar 2025 – $6,400 ATM cash payment applied to *Credit-Card A* → structuring alert
* 19 Mar 2025 – $5,000 Financial-center cash payment applied to *Credit-Card B* → structuring alert

The two March credits were single cash payments booked to two different credit-card balances and were not followed by additional sub-$10 k cash activity, mitigating the structuring concern.



Open-source business context

A Shelby-County docket lists “Gassan Jabber d/b/a La Fiesta Supermarket” at 1308 Getwell Road, Memphis.  Directory sources show further La Fiesta branches at 3500 S Mendenhall Road, 3662 Macon Road and 3124 S Perkins Road, while the Mendenhall site is registered as a MoneyGram agent.  These findings confirm a small, family-run grocery chain with remittance services and naturally high cash turnover.



Mitigation of cash-deposit alerts

Later statements reveal a weekly sweep pattern: cash deposits typically land every seven days in the $6 k–$9 k range (e.g., $9,000 on 24 Feb 2025 and $8,900 on 3 Mar 2025).  The January–February large deposits therefore sit squarely within normal revenue-collection behaviour, and the March payments addressed credit-card liabilities, not operating balances.  Taken together, the alerting transactions are consistent with routine cash management rather than structuring.



Routine inflows and outflows

*Account – Mayeda Jabber*

* Inflows

  * $9,000 cash deposit — 24 Feb 2025
  * $8,900 cash deposit — 3 Mar 2025
* Outflows

  * Regular tele-transfers to Jabber Mahmoud; open-source material lists him with La Fiesta, and the shared surname (Arabic names often appear in varying orders or spellings) supports a family/business link
  * $29 debit at Target — 26 May 2025

*Account – Jaber Ghassan*

* Inflows

  * P2P credit noted “rent” — 13 Jan 2025
  * $950 P2P credit noted “rent” — 28 Apr 2025
* Outflows

  * $66 debit at National Retail — 2 Jun 2025
  * $100 P2P payment to Hanady Ghassan — 24 Mar 2025 (surname match indicates family transfer)



Conclusion

Weekly revenue sweeps, isolated credit-card payments, and routine intra-family or business transfers explain the flagged activity.  No evidence of deliberate structuring or other illicit behaviour is present, so escalation to a SAR is not warranted; standard monitoring should continue.
