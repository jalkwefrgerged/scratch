An extended review was completed beginning on 12/02/2024  in order to cover all of the alerted activity. This reivew was triggered by automated alerts concerning abnormal Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transaction patterns and large ATM cash deposits made by Cesar Lope De Leon.

Cesar Lope De Leon's stated occupation is as an electrician with an employer name of Company Construction, per internal records. Leon's banking activity includes regular P2P transactions tied to his profession and occasional cash deposits that align with the norms of cash-intensive industries such as construction.

The P2P transaction alerts from December 2024 through March 2025 arose primarily due to high volumes of P2P transactions, significant proportions of such transactions relative to the account’s overall activity, and the rapid movement of funds into and out of the account. Upon careful analysis, these transactions represent Cesar’s typical professional activities, including income received from electrical work and payments made to subcontractors or assistants.

Illustrative examples help clarify this transactional pattern. On 5/29/2025, Cesar received two notable P2P credits: $1,520, described as "6 days of work," and another of $840, labeled as "pay for sat and sunday." Both clearly indicate compensation for professional services rendered. Additionally, earlier in the week, on 5/27/2025, he conducted two relevant P2P debit transactions: $350 described as "payment for installation of a cabinet reorder," and $220 as "payment for a day's work," clearly illustrating legitimate payments made to subcontractors for business-related purposes.

Such transactional behavior consistently aligns with typical financial operations within the construction and electrical industries, where receiving income via P2P methods and making corresponding payments to subcontractors is common practice.

Regarding the ATM cash deposits, three specific large deposits were flagged:

* $3,100 on 04/01/2025
* $5,000 on 04/11/2025
* $6,600 on 04/23/2025

Given Cesar’s employment in construction, a sector widely recognized for cash-intensive transactions, these deposits logically represent legitimate income earned through professional activities. Furthermore, the timing of these deposits—in early spring—is consistent with seasonal increases typically seen in the construction industry as projects intensify during this period. These deposits do not exhibit indicators of structuring or attempts to evade financial reporting requirements and are not considered unusual or egregious in the context provided.

To further substantiate the non-suspicious nature of the account, a sampling of recent inflows and outflows was conducted. Account inflows primarily comprise P2P credits related to professional activities, such as a $340 credit on 6/12/2025 noted as "materials for riverside," supplemented occasionally by cash deposits, such as the $450 deposited on 6/20/2025. Outflows similarly demonstrate regular professional and personal expenses, primarily through P2P debits—for example, $50 on 5/15/2025 with the note "work"—as well as discretionary spending via debit card, including a purchase of $108 at Home Depot on 5/16/2025. These transactions consistently align with normal business operations and routine personal expenditures.

In conclusion, after thorough analysis and careful consideration, the reviewed transactions clearly match Cesar Lope De Leon’s documented professional background, routine financial behaviors, and expected seasonal variations in business activity. No indications of suspicious or illicit activity have been identified.&#x20;
