OVERVIEW OF THE ALERTS

Between 8 January and 30 May 2025 the monitoring system raised three scenarios:

 Weekly cash spikes – single weeks whose cash totals exceeded earlier weeks in this new relationship.
 Large single ATM deposits – one or more envelopes of USD 5 000 + recorded in the same seven-day window.
 Possible structuring – two or more sub-USD 10 000 cash deposits recorded in a short period.

MITIGATION

J & M Legacy Construction operates as a residential contractor (NAICS 238990).  The deposits that generated alerts (USD 5 000 – 15 100 per week, plus three January–March spikes) match figures previously observed for single-project proceeds.  Outgoing items visible in the posting history—cheques to Y & P Construction and Andres Duarte and peer-to-peer payments annotated “porch paint,” “siding,” and “cabinet install”—show funds moving to subcontractor labour and materials rather than to high-risk parties.  The two structuring alerts (10 February and 17–19 March) are isolated and are not followed by any pattern of consecutive-day or multi-branch deposits.  Deposit locations (Snellville, Grayson, Cumming GA and Humble TX) match addresses already documented for the business.  Moreover, 

Taken together, the facts indicate routine business cash flow and not suspicious activity.

ONGOING CONTROLS

The relationship remains in the cash-intensive-business monitoring segment.  Escalation triggers are set for any future seven-day cash total above USD 25 000, for foreign transfers, or for posting-tab activity inconsistent with construction work.

These open-source findings show limited formal footprint and an unresolved civil suit but no sanctions, criminal cases, or confirmed negative media.  The thin registration/licensing profile is noted for ongoing KYB follow-up but does not, on its own, indicate money-laundering risk.
