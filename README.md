Overview of the cash alerts

From 1 March to 9 May 2025, three cash-related alerts were generated on the personal account of Igor Golubovich:

- Branch deposits that collectively pushed the total cash amount for March above ten thousand dollars:

  - 17 Mar 2025 — $3,500 
  - 17 Mar 2025 — $4,000 
  - 19 Mar 2025 — $5,000 
  - 31 Mar 2025 — $500 

- Branch deposits within a three-day span (17–19 March) suggesting potential structuring:

  - 17 Mar 2025 — $3,500 
  - 17 Mar 2025 — $4,000 
  - 19 Mar 2025 — $5,000 

- Three ATM cash deposits, each exceeding three thousand dollars:

  - 30 Apr 2025 — $3,500 
  - 07 May 2025 at 22:09 — $3,500 
  - 09 May 2025 at 17:27 — $4,300 

Upon review, no instances occurred in which cash deposits made within any rolling forty-eight-hour window totaled to or exceeded the regulatory reporting threshold of $10,000. Without such occurrences, the transactions do not reflect a clear pattern of intentionally splitting deposits to evade regulatory reporting. The timing and sizes of these deposits instead align with typical business receipts rather than deliberate structuring.

Open-source research and KYC documentation verify Mr. Golubovich as the owner of an electrical contracting company and as an executive of a restoration general contracting firm. Businesses of this type commonly collect cash for homeowner insurance deductibles, emergency repairs, and smaller on-site service fees. Transaction amounts ranging from $500 to $5,000 correspond directly with standard homeowner deductibles commonly associated with water or fire restoration jobs. Additionally, the ATM deposits, including after-hours transactions at 22:09 on 7 May and 17:27 on 9 May, represent after-hours deposit runs typical for contractors handling urgent, off-hours cash collections related to emergency homeowner repairs. The use of ATMs for these deposits is consistent with legitimate operational practices rather than avoidance of in-person interactions. Similarly, the branch deposits exceeded ten thousand dollars only in aggregate across multiple separate days in March, further demonstrating ordinary periodic business inflows.

Sampling of account inflows further supports the legitimacy of funds deposited into the account. Primary funding sources are wires from established entities such as Veristone Fund 1 LLC, including notable inflows of $22,670 and $19,220. Veristone Capital is a verified loan provider known to extend credit specifically for remodeling and construction services, aligning precisely with the customer’s stated business operations. Additional inflows include personal P2P transfers from family members, such as Galina Golubovich ($3,500 and $2,000 on 21 Jan 2025), consistent with typical family-related financial transactions. Similarly, account debits reinforce legitimate business use of the funds, such as a $396 business expense at Harbor Freight Tools on 20 Jan 2025 and recurring ACH payments toward remodeling-related financing provided by Veristone Capital, including the documented payment of $4,417 on 14 Jan 2025.

Overall, the documented inflows and outflows, confirmed business activity, verified funding sources, and typical industry practices collectively demonstrate legitimate transactions, providing no indication of suspicious structuring or attempts to avoid regulatory reporting. Therefore, a SAR filing is not warranted.
