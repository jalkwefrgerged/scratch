This year, I focused on deepening my regulatory expertise, enhancing collaboration, and quickly delivering practical solutions for my engagements.

The most impactful experience was supporting a Group B filer's resolution plan under Dodd-Frank. Our small team—just two to three primary writers—faced the challenge of producing a detailed, nearly 300-page regulatory document under tight deadlines. This required careful coordination, consistent narrative alignment, and continuous communication.

Early on, we encountered significant hurdles, as key client stakeholders lacked the necessary familiarity and preparation for the resolution-planning requirements. Although our initial scope was simply to document the bank’s processes “as is,” it quickly became clear that stakeholders needed targeted guidance to effectively participate. In response, I worked alongside more experienced colleagues to develop concise educational materials and reference guides, taking responsibility for several sections specific to my assigned areas. These materials clearly communicated regulatory expectations, facilitating smoother interactions, reducing confusion, and accelerating information gathering.

Given our tight timelines and resource constraints, I also adopted innovative methods to streamline our work. Leveraging AI-generated document summaries, I rapidly distilled key insights from over 200 pages of internal documentation, providing a clear baseline understanding of the bank’s operations. With this foundation, I collaborated closely with experienced resolution-planning colleagues and senior subject matter experts to identify over 40 regulatory and operational gaps. Drawing from these collaborative discussions, I specifically articulated and documented what "resolution-ready" processes should look like, clearly defining target states and actionable remediation steps for each identified gap.

When a contractor joined our team midway through the engagement, I quickly provided hands-on guidance, enabling seamless integration and maintaining our momentum. The ongoing need to align narratives across multiple authors required focused collaboration and clear, frequent communication—skills I strengthened significantly through this engagement.

In parallel, my involvement in an OCC-driven KYC remediation provided valuable operational experience. Daily, I reviewed customer profiles to identify compliance gaps and developed a straightforward Excel reconciliation tool that improved accuracy and reduced manual effort. Clearly documenting each step enabled this approach to become repeatable and scalable for future remediation efforts.

Facing these diverse challenges—tight deadlines, limited resources, stakeholder education, and narrative alignment—deepened my interest in how banks practically navigate complex regulations. The strategic insights from resolution planning, paired with hands-on KYC remediation, gave me complementary perspectives that drive my goal of gaining comprehensive regulatory expertise.

Looking forward, I am particularly interested in how emerging AI technologies will transform regulatory compliance. My background in computer science uniquely positions me to contribute to this evolving landscape, and I am eager to explore innovative compliance solutions and anticipate regulatory changes driven by technology. Next year, I plan to formalize the tools and educational resources developed this year for broader use, mentor a junior colleague, and lead governance-framework workshops, further expanding my knowledge and helping our clients navigate a complex and rapidly changing regulatory environment.
