Event Narrative:
Bank of America Global AML reviewed personal checking account held by Keevin Michael Kujawa (Party ID 40040005965, DOB [MM-DD-YYYY], Operations Manager – Food Service Center Inc.), for the period [start-date] to [end-date] (120-day look-back). Two surveillance rules triggered: ATM Cash Deposits (any single ATM cash deposit > $3 000) and Structured Cash Deposit Transaction (two or more cash deposits posted close together).

Activity that produced the Structured Cash Deposit alert centred on 19 March 2025. In the preceding days the customer made a string of small casino withdrawals—$300–$810 each—at Ameristar Casino, 1 Ameristar Blvd., St Charles MO ([ameristarstcharles.boydgaming.com][1]) and at Horseshoe St Louis, 999 N 2nd St., St Louis MO ([tripadvisor.com][2]). The two casinos are about 23 miles apart—well inside a normal local driving loop for St Louis gamblers. Four days later, on 19 March, the customer deposited $5 500 and $5 000 in cash, within hours of one another, at the Plaza 9th Street branch (800 Market St., St Louis). The twin deposits satisfied the structured-deposit rule, and the $5 500 item independently tripped the ATM-Cash-Deposit rule.

A second ATM Cash Deposit alert surfaced on 7 April 2025. After fresh casino cash-outs—$910 on 28 March (Ameristar), $308 on 2 April (Horseshoe), and $510 on 3 April (Ameristar)—the customer redeposited the funds at Bank of America’s St Charles branch, 1311 S 5th St. Three separate ATM deposits posted that day: $4 000, $2 000, and $1 000. The $4 000 credit alone exceeded the $3 000 threshold, and the trio of same-day deposits again met the “multiple-deposit” test.

Mitigating Analysis:
Nearly three-quarters of all cash debits in the review period—$43 782 of $58 800—originate from the two casinos, and equivalent sums are redeposited within zero to four days at either the 5th-Street or Market-Street branch, illustrating a consistent cash-out / cash-in gambling cycle rather than third-party cash placement. No deposit is split to remain just under $10 000; when a single win exceeded that level on 15 Nov 2024, CTR [CTR-reference-#] was filed, demonstrating the customer’s willingness to comply with reporting requirements. All activity stays inside the customer’s usual North-County-to-Downtown corridor, eliminating funnel-account concerns, and regular payroll ACH credits from Food Service Center Inc. align with the economic profile of a recreational gambler. Open-source checks reveal no criminal, civil, or sanctions issues for Keevin or spouse Kristen Kujawa.

Aggregate Totals: Cash debits $[total-cash-debits]; cash credits $[total-cash-credits].

SAR Codes (if filing required): Structuring → Transactions below CTR threshold; Large Cash Deposits ≥ $3 000.

Disposition: Recommend alert closure as not suspicious—Decision-Tree path B2—with continued routine monitoring. Prior SAR reference: [SAR-file-# or “None”].
