Acount activity triggered automateed alerts for large cash deposits and possible structuring. 

Specifically, two individual cash deposits triggered alerts due to their relatively large size:

* 30 January 2025: $5,800 cash deposit
* 28 February 2025: $5,900 cash deposit

Additionally, on 21 April 2025, four separate cash deposits made at the same ATM (1202 North Greenville Avenue, Allen, Texas 75002) within roughly six minutes triggered a potential structuring alert:

* $5,000 cash deposit
* $6,700 cash deposit
* $7,500 cash deposit
* $700 cash deposit

These four deposits totaled $19,900.

Following a thorough review, these transactions are not part of any suspicious activity or deliberate attempts to avoid regulatory reporting. The April deposits, although collectively nearing $20,000, were made consecutively at a single ATM within minutes. The quick succession and identical terminal identification suggest the deposits were likely the result of the ATM’s per-transaction limits or the customer's inability to carray all the cash in one trip rather than any intent to conceal the total amount. Furthermore, no additional 48-hour periods within the historical review revealed similar groupings of multiple deposits under $10,000 that collectively approached the regulatory threshold, indicating that this event was a one-time occurrence.

The earlier January and February deposits of $5,800 and $5,900 were the only sizable cash credits recorded within the previous twelve-month period. Analysis of the account’s inflow patterns demonstrated that cash deposits were infrequent and represented only a minor portion of overall account funding. Instead, routine direct deposits from payroll constituted the primary inflows. Examples include:

* $2,269 direct-deposit payroll from Yum! Connect LLC on 23 May 2025
* $1,003 direct-deposit payroll from Randstad on 12 June 2025

Outflows from the account further supported typical personal banking behavior. Notable examples included:

* $101 debit-card purchase at Hutchins BBQ on 24 March 2025 (routine dining)
* $63 ACH payment to the City of McKinney on 1 April 2025 (utility payment)

The consistency of payroll deposits and common discretionary expenses indicate standard financial management practices. Given the non-recurring nature of the alert-triggering transactions and the typical profile of account inflows and outflows, these cash deposit activities are determined to be not suspicious.
