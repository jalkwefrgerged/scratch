The account generated alerts for several larger ATM cash deposits. Although individually larger in amount, these deposits occurred infrequently and were spread across multiple months, reflecting moderate and reasonable levels of cash activity.

Transactions that triggered the alert:
- 10-Feb-2025 — ATM cash deposit $6,300.00
- 10-Apr-2025 — ATM cash deposit $4,800.00
- 10-Jun-2025 — ATM cash deposit $6,000.00
- 10-Jun-2025 — ATM cash deposit $6,000.00

The two deposits made on 10-Jun-2025 were conducted at the same ATM within five minutes around 6:30 AM, likely reflecting convenience rather than attempts at concealment. These cash deposits directly funded subsequent transfers into Robinhood, a recognized brokerage platform used for personal investing, including a $6,000 transfer on 12-Feb-2025 and a $13,000 transfer on 11-Jun-2025.

This pattern of promptly transferring deposited funds into Robinhood aligns with typical and legitimate personal investment practices rather than suspicious financial behavior. Generally, suspicious fund movements involve multiple intermediaries, layered transactions, deliberate concealment, or interactions with unfamiliar counterparties. In contrast, these deposits directly moved into a known and reputable brokerage without intermediaries or concealment efforts, indicating transparent and ordinary personal financial management.

A sampling of account inflows and outflows further supports the ordinary and nonsuspicious nature of the account activity. Inflows were predominantly via ACH, including a $9,000 deposit from Robinhood and payroll credits from GustoPayroll, such as $1,124 on 3-Jun-2025. Outflows primarily consisted of regular ACH payments, exemplified by a $600 payment to Citi Credit Card on 23-Jun-2025, alongside typical discretionary spending like a $16 payment to Amazon on 11-Jun-2025. The consistent relationship between regular inflows and ordinary household expenditures further underscores the legitimacy and transparency of the account activity.

There is no evidence of suspicious activity or common tactics typically associated with illicit financial conduct, such as rapid cycling, layering, concealment of transactions, or unexplained fund accumulation.
