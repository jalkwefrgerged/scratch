1. Overview of Alerts
Between mid-March and early April 2025, Bank of America’s monitoring systems generated two distinct alert conditions on accounts held by the subject:

 Structuring Alerts
  Two cash withdrawals just below the $10,000 CTR threshold were flagged as potential structuring in the subject’s personal checking account (ending in 2224).

 Large Cash Deposit Alert
  A single cash deposit of $27,000 on April 8, 2025 into the corporate account of HONDATA, Inc. (ending in 2843) breached the customer’s 90th-percentile weekly deposit threshold.



2. Chronology of Transactions

 March 17, 2025
  $9,000 cash withdrawal from personal checking …2224 at the Torrance Financial Center on 21700 Hawthorne Boulevard triggered a structuring alert.

 March 19, 2025
  $9,500 cash withdrawal from the same account and branch again triggered a structuring alert.

 April 8, 2025
  $27,000 cash deposit into corporate account …2843 at the Financial Center on 1255 Sartori Avenue, Torrance CA 90501 generated a large-deposit alert.



3. Mitigation Analysis – Corporate Deposit & Account Activity
HONDATA, Inc. is a specialized California C-Corp that designs and distributes Honda/Acura engine-management hardware and tuning software. The $27,000 deposit on April 8, 2025 was made at a branch less than two miles from the company’s Torrance headquarters, indicating a routine, convenient location for corporate deposits. Because HONDATA makes relatively few cash deposits, this transaction most plausibly reflects an aggregation of numerous smaller cash payments collected since its last deposit—consistent with standard cash-management practices rather than evasion of reporting.

Viewed alongside other revenue channels and normal disbursements, the deposit’s branch proximity, infrequency of cash deposits, and relative size support a benign source-of-funds explanation:

 Inflows

   ACH – $14,768 on January 23, 2025 (Intuit)
   ACH – $12,806 on January 24, 2025 (Square, Inc.)
   Check – $2,284 on April 30, 2025 (Account …2284) payable to Hondata, Inc. from David Yu

 Outflows

   ADP Wage Payroll (ACH – $81,955 on May 29, 2025)
   ADP Tax Remittance (ACH – $57,710 on April 15, 2025)
   ADT Security Services (ACH – $948 on April 28, 2025)
   Check – $690 on February 12, 2025, payable to ADP, Inc.

These routine electronic inflows and corporate outflows for payroll, taxes, security, and invoiced services align with HONDATA’s operational profile and reinforce that the $27,000 cash deposit was sourced and used for legitimate business purposes.



4. Mitigation Analysis – Structuring Alerts
Between March 17 and March 19, 2025, two cash withdrawals of $9,000 and $9,500 were executed from the subject’s personal checking account (…2224) at the Hawthorne Boulevard branch. Although each was below the $10,000 CTR threshold, their combined total of $18,500 generated a structuring alert.

A review of the prior 52 weeks of cash-withdrawal activity in that account shows no other sub-$10,000 withdrawals or repeated thresholding patterns. These two transactions represent a one-time event, and subsequent account activity demonstrates routine, legitimate use:

 Personal Inflows & Outflows

   ACH credit from HONDATA, Inc. of $21,459 on May 30, 2025
   ACH credit from HONDATA, Inc. of $21,459 on June 13, 2025
   ACH debit for Verizon Wireless of $616 on June 9, 2025
   Debit-card purchase at Ralph’s of $78 on May 31, 2025

These regular electronic credits and personal expenditures further support that the two sub-threshold withdrawals were not indicative of an ongoing structuring scheme.
