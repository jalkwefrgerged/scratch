Comprehensive Narrative of Alert Review and Mitigation

Overview of Alerts:

From December 2024 through March 2025, multiple alerts were triggered for unusual cash activities involving personal customer Han Seob Kim and business customer EZ Home Public Adjuster, Corp. (NAICS 524210 – Insurance-related services). The alerts comprised:

- Large ATM cash deposit – Personal (Dec 2024)
- Large cash deposits – Personal (Mar 2025)
- Large ATM cash deposits – Business (Mar 2025)
- Structured cash deposits – Business (Mar 2025)

Detailed Alerting Transactions:

Structured Cash Deposits – Business:

- March 18, 2025: $9,000
- March 19, 2025: $5,000

Large Cash Deposits – Personal:

- March 18, 2025: $9,000
- March 21, 2025: $8,500

ATM Cash Deposits – Personal:

- December 14, 2024: $4,790
  

ATM Cash Deposits – Business:

- March 15, 2025: $5,000
- March 19, 2025: $7,500
  

Shortly after the cash deposits from March 18–21, 2025, two checks were issued on March 24, 2025, payable to CARMAX. One check, amounting to $20,000, was drawn from the business account, while the other, totaling $18,807, was issued from the personal account. Both checks included memos referencing "CARMAX TITAN TRADEIN," indicating an automotive-related transaction consistent with vehicle purchase or trade-in. Cash deposits into separate accounts align with standard financial management practices, ensuring clarity and accuracy in reflecting distinct sources of income. Utilizing funds from different accounts for a single vehicle transaction does not inherently raise suspicion, as it demonstrates intentional recordkeeping and separation of business and personal finances.

The structured cash deposits on March 18 and 19, 2025, constitute the sole instance within the review period where cumulative deposits surpassed the $10,000 threshold in under 48 hours. An exhaustive review identified no other similar activities or attempts indicative of intentional evasion of reporting requirements. The cash and ATM deposits align with common and expected practices within the roofing and public-adjuster industry, where handling sizable cash payments for insurance deductibles or interim expenses from homeowners is routine. Open-source research confirms that EZ Home Public Adjuster Corp. operates legitimately within the roofing and public-adjuster sector, a business inherently characterized by periodic large cash inflows from homeowners to manage insurance deductibles or interim claim-related expenses.&#x20;

To further substantiate the legitimate nature of these transactions, a sampling of business account held by EZ Home Public Adjuster, Corp. activities revealed predominantly check-based credits, such as a $2,000 deposit from HomePro Restoration Inc. on June 2, 2025. Routine business expenses, including a $500 payment to the Illinois Department of Revenue on March 14, 2025, further illustrate ordinary financial operations typical for a business within the roofing and public-adjuster industry.

A sampling of the personal account held by Kim Jae Young also shows legitimate financial activities. Predominantly peer-to-peer (P2P) inflows, such as a $4,500 payment from Judy on June 9, 2025, noted as reimbursement for hotel rooms and travel, reflect routine personal financial behavior. Typical household expenses such as the ACH payment of $1,080 to Chase on April 15, 2025, to clear a credit card balance further support the non-suspicious character of these transactions.

Similarly, the sampled financial activities for the account of Han Seob Kim reflect standard household and personal financial practices. Inflows primarily consist of routine checks from EZ Home Public Adjuster Corp., including a $2,000 payment on April 18, 2025, alongside P2P payments such as a $200 transaction from Excel Public Adjusters, Inc. on May 18, 2025. Outflows are typical household and living expenses, exemplified by a regular car payment of $1,012 on December 24, 2024, and standard ACH payments for utilities, such as a $77 payment to ComEd on June 6, 2025.

Considering the single occurrence of the structured transaction, absence of systematic evasion attempts, and clear, legitimate financial management practices demonstrated by the sampled transactions, the reviewed activities are not indicative of suspicious financial conduct.
