Open-source records list Joseph Perry as the Housing Department Manager for Santa Rosa Rancheria; his name and title show on the tribe’s housing page. ()   The tribe—also known as the Tachi-Yokut Tribe—owns and operates the on-site Tachi Palace Hotel & Casino ()  Because Perry’s office sits on that reservation campus, he works in an environment where bonuses, income, and/or certain tribal stipends can be paid out in cash. 



The activity is being deemed not suspicous becuase of the lack of a reoccuring pattern and the casino-releated nature of the cash activity. Five month-opening deposits arrive as single $5 k–$6 k bundles.  Each is one intact lump—never sliced over a short time period—so the behaviour lacks structuring hallmarks.  Given the tribe’s practice of paying incentives, gaming proceeds, or benefit distributions in cash, these deposits plausibly reflect legitimate income that Perry recieves from the tribe.


Perry routinely pulls $200–$400 at the casino ATM located at 317 Tachhi PA-7218 Lemoore, CA. For instance, he made withdrawl of $204 on 04 Apr 2025 and $104 on 03 Mar 2025. He also makes modest card purchases at the Tachi Palace Hotel where the tribal casino is located, e.g., $77 on 19 May 2025, and also makes also discretionary purchases such as $32 at Taco Bell on 20 May 2025. THis reflects everyday living and casual gaming for someone already on the property.


The structuring alert was caused by a $10,000 withdrawal on 19 Mar 2025 at Perry's usual Hanford branch (where he made the cash deposits) that coincided with his regular day-to-day debits at the casino ATM, specifically the two $204 withdrawls on 18 Mar 2025 at the casino ATM. This single withdrawl likely represents a one-time splurge. It is not part of a consistent pattern of splitting large cash deposits over short periods of time to avoid filing requirements. Taken together—regular monthly cash deposits likley tied to triabl cash payments, routine small cash outs, and consumer-level card spends—the account aligns with normal personal finance for a tribal employee in a cash-rich setting, not with layering or systematic structuring.


A sampling of inflows & outflows reinforce that Perry’s account functions like an ordinary personal checking account anchored to a cash-intensive casino workplace.
- Inflows: Weekly ACH payroll from Santa Rosa Rancheria ($645 on 22 May 2025) and small Zelle credits from Angel Barbosa ($20 “casino food” on 15 May 2025).
- Outflows: Typical $200–$400 cash pulls at the casino ATM (e.g., $204 and $304 on 11 Apr 2025) plus discretionary card spends such as $77 at the Tachi Palace Hotel (19 May 2025) and $32 at Taco Bell (20 May 2025).
