The account generated two alerts during the review period related to structured cash deposits and ATM cash deposits.

The structured-cash-deposit alert involved two cash deposits made at the same ATM (1571 Elliott Road, Gilbert, AZ) on 28-Apr-2025:
	•	$4,700 at 13:51
	•	$6,800 at 13:58

These deposits occurred at the same location within seven minutes, indicating customer convenience rather than structuring or concealment. The deposits directly funded a large ACH payment of $10,135 on 29-Apr-2025, explicitly labeled with the customer’s own name. Given this description, the transaction likely represents a straightforward transfer between personal accounts. Four days earlier (24-Apr-2025), the customer withdrew $500 at Evie Casino Arizona in Scottsdale, just 15 minutes from the deposit location, plausibly indicating casino winnings or leftover recreational cash deposited afterward. No other similar deposit groupings occurred, reinforcing a lack of suspicious intent.

Separately, the ATM cash-deposit alert included deposits such as the $4,900 ATM deposit on 03-Mar-2025. Total cash inflows remained moderate and not egregious. This particular deposit directly funded routine expenses, notably a loan payment via ACH to Mr. Cooper of $2,549 on 05-Mar-2025. This direct use demonstrates ordinary household financial management rather than suspicious activity.

Additional account context supports the legitimacy of these transactions. ACH inflows primarily reflect payroll, including deposits of $3,370 from Gila River Gaming on 27-May-2025 and $1,285 from Barrett Business on 07-Mar-2025. Regular outflows include predictable payments such as $415 to Allstate Insurance on 03-Jun-2025, a $600 ACH payment to Citi Credit Card on 23-Jun-2025, and typical debit-card spending, like an $18 charge at Costco on 20-Mar-2025.

Moreover, account records show continued casino-related activity, such as a cash withdrawal of $1,006 at Harrah’s Laughlin Beach Resort & Casino in Laughlin, Nevada, on 13-Jun-2025. This pattern suggests recreational use and routine redepositing behavior rather than suspicious fund movements.

Overall, there were no indicators of suspicious behaviors such as rapid cycling, layering, concealment attempts, use of unknown counterparties, or unexplained fund accumulations. The account’s activity during the review period consistently aligns with typical personal financial management.
