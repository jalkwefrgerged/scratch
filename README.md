Mitigation Summary:
An extensive review revealed no evidence of additional sub-48-hour transactions or any broader repetitive pattern of structuring. The transactions on March 18 and 19, 2025, although initially flagged, do not form part of a consistent or repeated strategy designed to evade regulatory reporting requirements.

Further, the large ATM cash deposits observed align with the documented employment records of the parties involved. Internal records show Beatriz Razon employed as a laborer at PizzaPie. Jose Parraâ€™s stated occupation is taxi driver, with ACAPULCOS listed as his employer. Open-source research confirms that ACAPULCOS is a restaurant located in Enfield, Connecticut, operated by Cerritos Enfield LLC. Specifically, property tax listings from the Enfield, Connecticut government confirm that Cerritos Enfield LLC operates ACAPULCOS Mexican restaurants. Additionally, the company's website confirms the existence of an ACAPULCOS restaurant located at 61 Paloma Drive, Enfield, Connecticut 06082. Both occupations typically involve cash transactions, rendering the observed cash deposit amounts consistent with legitimate occupational cash flows.

A sampling of inflows and outflows further supports legitimate financial activity. Inflows include regular payroll checks received by Jose Parra from Cerritos Enfield LLC, such as $219 on May 27, 2025, and $161 on April 6, 2025, and consistent cash deposits such as $2,320 on January 13, 2025, and $2,500 on February 3, 2025. Outflows primarily involve routine debit card expenditures for typical discretionary items, including a purchase at Costco for $605 on February 6, 2025, and ACH payments to settle credit card accounts, such as a payment to American Express for $103 on May 21, 2025.

Based on these considerations, the transactions in question do not represent suspicious activity warranting additional investigation or reporting.
