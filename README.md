This year, I focused on deepening my regulatory expertise, enhancing collaboration, and quickly delivering practical solutions for my engagements.

The most impactful experience was supporting a Group B filer's resolution plan under Dodd-Frank. Our small team—just two to three primary writers—faced the challenge of producing a detailed, nearly 300-page regulatory document under tight deadlines. This required careful coordination, consistent narrative alignment, and continuous communication.

Early on, we encountered significant hurdles, as key client stakeholders lacked the necessary familiarity and preparation for the resolution-planning requirements. Although our initial scope was simply to document the bank’s processes “as is,” it quickly became clear that stakeholders needed targeted guidance to effectively participate. In response, I worked alongside more experienced colleagues to develop concise educational materials and reference guides, taking responsibility for several sections specific to my assigned areas. These materials clearly communicated regulatory expectations, facilitating smoother interactions, reducing confusion, and accelerating information gathering.

Given our tight timelines and resource constraints, I also adopted innovative methods to streamline our work. Leveraging AI-generated document summaries, I rapidly distilled key insights from over 200 pages of internal documentation, providing a clear baseline understanding of the bank’s operations. With this foundation, I collaborated closely with experienced resolution-planning colleagues and senior subject matter experts to identify over 40 regulatory and operational gaps. Drawing from these collaborative discussions, I specifically articulated and documented what "resolution-ready" processes should look like, clearly defining target states and actionable remediation steps for each identified gap.

When a contractor joined our team midway through the engagement, I quickly provided hands-on guidance, enabling seamless integration and maintaining our momentum. As the resolution plan was coming together, I proactively ensured narrative alignment across sections, carefully tracked cross-dependencies between multiple workstreams, and collaborated closely with senior writers to maintain consistency, coherence, and readiness across the entire 300-page document.

Earliar in the year, I participated in an OCC-driven KYC remediation, an engagement that offered a valuable contrast to the high-level regulatory perspective gained from the resolution-planning project. This remediation work provided direct exposure to the daily operational challenges banks face when meeting regulatory compliance requirements. I reviewed customer profiles in detail to pinpoint documentation gaps. This ground-level experience significantly enriched my understanding of how banks navigate complex regulations day-to-day, complementing and deepening the strategic insights I had gained earlier in the resolution-plan engagement. Now, I'm working on an AML surge project, rapidly analyzing suspicious activity alerts and drafting investigative narratives—further deepening my understanding of ground-level regulatory compliance.


Navigating these projects provided valuable insights into how banks handle regulation at both strategic and operational levels. Tackling tight deadlines, resource constraints, stakeholder education, and narrative alignment reinforced my interest in understanding the full spectrum of regulatory complexities banks face. Next year, my primary goal is to deepen my understanding of the regulatory landscape by exploring additional areas of banking compliance and learning more comprehensively about the diverse challenges financial institutions encounter. Additionally, with my background in computer science, I am particularly interested in how large language models will reshape the regulatory compliance landscape—from automating regulatory workflows and analysis to changing how banks engage with regulators. I hope to leverage my technical background to help build innovative solutions that enable clients to anticipate these emerging trends and effectively navigate an increasingly complex compliance landscape. All in all, this year significantly deepened my understanding of regulatory compliance, and I look forward to further expanding my knowledge base and building innovative solutions in the year ahead.
