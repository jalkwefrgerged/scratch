Event Narrative – Estate Administration

Bank of America Global AML reviewed checking account ••••[Acct-last-4], previously held by Patricia (Sullivan) Brooks (Party ID 55105478945, DOB 05-Sep-1953, deceased 27-Feb-2025). Post-death transaction monitoring generated alerts for two instances of Large Cash Deposit – Personal Velocity (weeks of 02–08 Mar 2025 and 16–22 Mar 2025) and one Cash Structuring Pattern alert (17–19 Mar 2025).

Upon thorough review and analysis, the alerted transactions were determined not suspicious, as supported by the context of estate administration activities, documented estate purposes, and the nature of the cash flows.

Reasoning for Non-Suspicion Determination:

Leveraging extensive analysis and research into the account activities and involved parties, the cash deposits correlate closely with typical estate administration practices, including liquidation of personal property and subsequent asset distribution.

Examples Supporting Determination:

* Inflows:

  * Deposits of $9,000 each on 03-Mar-2025 and 07-Mar-2025 occurred near the decedent's Brewster, MA home, aligning geographically and temporally with clearing and local liquidation activities.
  * Subsequent deposits of $9,100 and $9,000 on 17-Mar-2025 and 19-Mar-2025 at a Bank of America location in Thornton, CO, correspond logically with personal items having been shipped to Executor [Sieban/Executor 2] for appraisal and sale.

* Outflows:

  * Payments since the decedent's death indicate legitimate estate expenses, including funeral services, probate-related legal fees (paid to [Law-firm name]), property taxes (Barnstable County), and licensed tradespersons handling property maintenance, totaling $[Estate-expense-subtotal].
  * Checks labeled "Tax-free gift" were issued to listed heirs, with an example transaction of $8,000 to Tyler Sullivan Prado on [Check-date], consistent with IRS annual gift-tax limits, totaling $[Beneficiary-gift-total].

Structuring Assessment:

The analysis shows no evidence of structuring:

* Deposits are clearly discrete and appropriately timed, avoiding suspicious splitting patterns.
* Historical transaction activity confirms ongoing compliance with reporting requirements (CTR filings last documented as [CTR-file-# or “N/A”]).

Control Documentation and Security Measures:

* Estate documentation including letters testamentary, death certificate, and shipment receipts confirming asset liquidation were uploaded and validated within KYC records as of [Doc-upload-date].
* No unauthorized access or account information modifications have been recorded since the date of death.

Aggregate Estate Activity (02 Mar – 22 Mar 2025):

* Total cash inflows: $36,100
* Estate expenses total: $[Estate-expense-subtotal]
* Total beneficiary gift distributions: $[Beneficiary-gift-total]

Preliminary Disposition:

It is recommended to close the alerts from March 2025 concerning large cash deposits and structuring patterns as "Not Suspicious – Estate Administration," contingent upon:

* Final verification of identity and authority for executors [Executor 1 name] and [Executor 2 name / Robert “Rob” Sieban].
* Maintenance of comprehensive estate documentation and copies of all relevant transaction records in the case file.
* Continued monitoring of the account activity until probate distribution is completed, with a mandate to escalate to SAR filing if future activity significantly diverges from established estate expense or beneficiary gift distribution patterns.

Placeholders to be completed:

* Branch teller IDs (if required)
* Executor names and official appointment dates
* Account retitling date
* Robert “Rob” Sieban Party ID
* Detailed subtotals for estate expenses and beneficiary gift distributions
* CTR and SAR reference numbers (if applicable)
