An investigation has been completed, and no SAR is being filed at this time.

The customer’s account generated several alerts during March 2025 related to cash deposit activity, specifically: an Early-March Alert triggered by ATM cash deposits totaling \$5,590; a Mid-March Spike due to a cash deposit of \$10,000 exceeding historical averages; a Single-Day Structuring alert involving multiple cash deposits totaling \$10,100; and a Late-March ATM Deposit alert related to a single ATM cash deposit of \$3,100.

In detail, the transactions included ATM cash deposits of \$1,000 on March 4 and \$4,590 on March 5, both conducted at the branch located at 6051 North Fry Road, Katy, TX. On March 19, 2025, three separate cash deposits were recorded at the customer’s primary home branch located at 7770 North Highway 6, Houston, TX: a structured cash deposit of \$10,000; an additional structured cash deposit of \$100; and a large cash deposit of \$10,000. Notably, the \$10,000 deposit was immediately followed approximately ten minutes later by a withdrawal of the same amount, resulting in no significant net account balance change. Lastly, an ATM cash deposit of \$3,100 occurred at the same Houston branch on March 24, 2025.

Open-source research conducted as part of this investigation indicates that the alerted activity aligns with the customer’s documented business profile. The customer, Obumneme Ibekwe, reported employment as both a taxi driver in Lagos, Nigeria, and a part-time stylist affiliated with Elite Braids & Weaving—a recognized cash-intensive business publicly listed at 17411 FM 529 Rd, Houston, TX 77095. Public records confirm Elite Braids’ Copperfield location is situated approximately 1.9 miles west of the customer's home branch at 7770 North Highway 6, Houston, TX, and approximately 3.4 miles east of the 6051 North Fry Road branch, supporting plausible geographic rationale for the observed transactional behavior.

Both occupations reported by the customer—taxi services in Lagos and hair-braiding services in Houston—are identified by U.S. and Nigerian regulators, including the U.S. Treasury and FinCEN, as inherently cash-intensive industries. The activity observed aligns closely with these established cash-intensive business profiles.

The notable \$10,000 cash deposit and subsequent withdrawal on March 19, while initially triggering concern due to the proximity of these transactions (approximately ten minutes apart), represents an isolated event. The entire set of alerted transactions occurred exclusively at the customer’s single home branch location at 7770 North Highway 6. No multi-center transactional patterns indicative of “smurfing” or coordinated structuring attempts were observed.

Open-source due diligence revealed no adverse media, sanctions-list matches, regulatory concerns, or licensing actions related to Mr. Ibekwe or Elite Braids & Weaving from January 2023 onward.

Based upon the consistency of the transactions with the customer’s legitimate business activity, the exclusive use of a single home branch without a pattern indicative of structuring or smurfing, and the absence of adverse or suspicious information, the alerted transactions do not appear suspicious at this time.
