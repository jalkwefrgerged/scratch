The observed pattern of $72,617 in cash deposits over four months cannot plausibly align with the operational realities of NMAH Trucking LLC, which maintains inactive FMCSA authority and operates only a single truck. Legitimate trucking revenues are characteristically settled electronically via ACH or checks, making repeated substantial cash deposits highly irregular within the industry. Moreover, even under ideal conditions, the cash inflows average approximately $18,000 per monthâ€”more than three times the typical net monthly earnings for an owner-operator and close to the maximum possible gross revenue, an unrealistic scenario given the company's inactive regulatory status and absence of documented freight activity. Coupled with the lack of standard operational signals, such as inspections, crash reports, tax filings, or customer reviews, these funds lack a credible business justification. Consequently, the origin of these cash deposits remains unaccounted for, rendering the activity suspicious and meriting further AML scrutiny and investigation.
