Destiny Delynne North first triggered a **large-cash-deposit alert** when she brought \$12,259 in currency to the Holiday, Florida branch on 6 March 2025.  A look-back revealed additional cash placements that share the same “no-known-source” characteristic:

• 03/06/2025 – \$12,259 cash deposit – Holiday, FL
• 05/27/2025 – \$12,000 cash deposit – Weeki Wachee, FL
• 05/02/2025 – \$2,000  cash deposit – Weeki Wachee, FL
• 04/17/2025 – \$1,000  cash deposit – Weeki Wachee, FL
• 04/15/2025 – \$1,000  cash deposit – Weeki Wachee, FL
• 04/08/2025 – \$1,800  cash deposit – Spring Hill, FL

No documentation accompanied any of these deposits, and open-source checks could not confirm an active nursing licence—the occupation the customer lists—or any cash-based enterprise that would explain \$46,800 in currency received within ninety days.  The absence of a verifiable source renders the deposit pattern suspicious.

A **possible-structured-withdrawals alert** fired two weeks later when North began drawing the money out in near-threshold amounts:

• 03/05/2025 – \$1,900 cash withdrawal – ATM \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
• 03/06/2025 – \$5,000 cash withdrawal – ATM \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
• 03/14/2025 – \$5,000 cash withdrawal – ATM \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
• 03/18/2025 – \$10,000 cash withdrawal – ATM \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
• 03/19/2025 – \$4,300 cash withdrawal – ATM \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The final two debits, executed on consecutive business days at different locations, kept each day’s cash total at or below the \$10,000 CTR threshold while removing \$14,300 in twenty-four hours.  Four sub-threshold debits within fourteen days, spread across multiple sites, form a pattern consistent with multi-day structuring.  No credible purpose for this rapid cash movement has been established, and the customer has not been available to explain.

Because substantial sums of cash entered and exited the account without a confirmed origin or legitimate rationale—and because the withdrawal sequence mirrors recognised structuring behaviour—this activity will be reported as suspicious for unknown source of funds and possible structuring.  A SAR is being filed with supporting transaction records, and the account has been placed under enhanced monitoring pending further verification of employment and income.
