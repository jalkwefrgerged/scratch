Anderson Veloso Moreira controls two Florida entities at 12114 Irwin Manor Dr, Jacksonville: Pro Outdoor Solutions Corp (website markets full outdoor remodeling—landscaping, hard-scape, pool upgrades) and Moreira Professional Services Corp. Payroll checks from the latter are routinely deposited, reflecting owner compensation.


Cash activity totals $28,100 across five single-lump deposits. There is only a sinlge instance of sub-48 hour deposits which aggregate to above the reproting threshold: the $6,300 on 17-Mar and $6,000 on 19-Mar—did. No similar sub-48hr clusters are present during the review period. Mid-March marks peak outdoor-remodeling season in Florida, when multiple projects close and clients can potentially pay on site in the form of cash.

The wires of $20,000 and $10,230, sent three days apart, were directed to Rezzy Motorsports, an established domestic powersports dealer (). A two-part “deposit plus balance-due” schedule fits purchase of a utility/ATV vehicle useful for hauling trailers, landscaping materials, and pool-construction supplies into confined backyards. 

A sampling on inflows and outflows further supports a picture of regular business operations and non-suspicous activity,
- 08-Apr-2025 — $6,500 check labeled “pool paid in full,” evidencing pool-remodel revenue.
- Regular payroll checks from Moreira Professional Services Corp, e.g., $1,276 deposited 11-Mar-2025.
- Teller transfers to established domestic counterparties such Top Cars Auto Group. As a client of Bank of America customer, Top cars Auto Group is listed as an automotive dealer and open source research reveals an active businesss regression with the state of Florida (). Top Cars Auto Group is an estbalished business and does not pose high-risk characteristics.
- Debit-card fuel and hardware purchases: 22 posts ranging $38–$212 during the period.

Taken together, the cash deposits, related-party payroll, pool-remodel check, equipment wires, and routine transfers to known merchants reflect ordinary seasonal revenue and legitimate business expenditures for a cash-intensive outdoor-remodeling enterprise and do not raise reasonable suspicion of money laundering or structuring.
