Mitigation Summary:
Upon further review, multiple cash deposits clearly exceed the regulatory reporting threshold, demonstrating a clear willingness to transact openly without attempts to evade reporting requirements. Notable examples include a business deposit of $15,000 on June 16, 2025, and personal deposits of $13,000 on March 25, 2025, $13,446 on March 10, 2025, and $19,327 on December 23, 2024. This frequent openness in handling large transactions provides strong evidence against intentional structuring behaviors.

Additionally, open-source research has thoroughly confirmed the legitimate existence and active operational status of J&M Legacy Construction LLC. Georgia Secretary of State business filings explicitly list Jose Martinez as an organizer, and the documented address matches internal account records. J&M Legacy Construction LLC operates in the specialty trade contractors sector—an industry traditionally characterized by substantial cash payments and regular cash transactions. The observed deposit volumes and transaction frequency align with normal industry practices.

A sampling of inflows and outflows from the business account further solidifies the legitimacy of the account activities. Inflows include clearly labeled payments associated with specific construction services, such as checks for $8,500 for "sliding labor" (March 14, 2025), $1,850 for "rofin work" (December 25, 2024), and a $1,800 P2P transaction labeled "flooring" (May 16, 2024). Outflows include business-specific expenses, such as payments to subcontractors and for construction materials, including an $8,000 check to LAAConstructionPro LLC (February 24, 2025), an $800 check marked "Marietta Roof" (March 24, 2025), and a lumber purchase via debit card for $147 (May 15, 2025).

Similarly, the personal account of Jose Martinez reflects legitimate income sources and typical personal expenditures. Notable inflows include a $1,000 P2P transfer from ALS Renovations LLC marked "Framing," and a substantial $23,600 check from Willow Framing (February 24, 2025). Outflows reflect routine personal expenditures, exemplified by a debit transaction at Hobby Lobb for $24 (June 18, 2025), and regular ACH payments such as a $120 payment to Best Buy (June 16, 2025).

Collectively, the verified legitimacy of business operations, the clarity and consistency of documented financial transactions, and the presence of multiple transactions explicitly exceeding reporting thresholds significantly mitigate concerns of intentional structuring or suspicious financial activities.
