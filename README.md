The cash deposits listed above reflect a clear and consistent pattern of structuring intended to evade regulatory reporting requirements. Specifically, on nine separate days, the subject deposited amounts totaling between $9,500 and $10,000, and on four additional days, exactly $10,000—demonstrating repeated intent to remain just below or at the Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold as defined by 31 CFR § 1010.311. Additionally, 19 of these 22 transactions cluster into two narrow denominations—roughly $7,400-$7,700 and $2,300-$2,600—further indicating deliberate structuring. This near-threshold deposit pattern persisted over approximately 14 weeks, highlighting ongoing intentional activity rather than isolated incidents. A single outlier date (15 Apr 2025) at $17,200 may represent either a lapse or an exceptional cash-placement need. Taken together, this behavior strongly indicates deliberate structuring to evade mandatory CTR reporting requirements.

Further supporting suspicion, internal records identify Javier Ramos as an executive at Right Buy Auto Sales, while Paloma Gonzalez has a stated occupation as a homemaker, listing Chase as her employer. Neither occupation reasonably explains or aligns with the substantial and frequent cash deposit activity observed here, reinforcing concerns about the legitimacy of these transactions and underscoring the likelihood that structuring has occurred.
