Event Narrative (Final Draft with Placeholders)

An investigation has been completed into activity on Bank of America checking account ••••[Acct-last-4], originally held by Patricia (Sullivan) Brooks (Party ID 55105478945, DOB 05-Sep-1953, deceased 27-Feb-2025). No Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is being filed.

Overview of Alerted Activity:
Following the documented death of Patricia Brooks, the account triggered two automated monitoring rules: Large Cash Deposit – Personal Velocity (for the weeks of 02–08 Mar 2025 and 16–22 Mar 2025) and Cash Structuring Pattern (covering 17–19 Mar 2025). These alerts resulted from multiple large cash deposits, each close to but below the $10,000 Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold.

Detailed Analysis of Alerted Transactions:
The four alerted cash deposits were as follows:

 03-Mar-2025: $9,000 cash deposit at Bank of America financial center in Orleans, MA (30 S Orleans Rd, near decedent’s Brewster residence).
 07-Mar-2025: $9,000 cash deposit at the same Orleans financial center.
 17-Mar-2025: $9,100 cash deposit at Bank of America financial center in Thornton, CO (9680 Grant St, near the address of Robert “Rob” Sieban).
 19-Mar-2025: $9,000 cash deposit at the same Thornton financial center.

Reasons Why the Activity is Not Suspicious:
The investigation concluded the alerted transactions reflect legitimate estate-administration activities, based on the following factors:

1. Estate Administration Context:

    The account was re-titled “Estate of Patricia S. Brooks” effective [Acct-retitle-date], following documented date of death (27-Feb-2025). Estate-related documentation, including letters testamentary and the death certificate, have been provided and retained.
    Deposits in Massachusetts align geographically and temporally with estate settlement procedures, specifically cash recovery during clean-out of the decedent’s residence.
    Deposits in Colorado correspond to cash proceeds from personal effects sent to the second authorized estate representative, Robert “Rob” Sieban ([role: e.g., co-executor/beneficiary – specify]), for appraisal and liquidation.

2. Account Outflow Patterns:

    Account debits subsequent to deposits show clear alignment with typical estate expenses, including payments to the funeral home ([funeral home name]), probate attorney ([Law-firm name]), Barnstable County tax office, and property-maintenance vendors. These transactions total $[Estate-expense-subtotal].
    Additional distributions labeled as “Tax-free gift” payments, such as an $8,000 check to Tyler Sullivan Prado dated [Check-date], match heirs listed as payable-on-death (POD) beneficiaries. These beneficiary distributions total $[Beneficiary-gift-total].
    No transfers were made to unrelated third parties, money service businesses (MSBs), or higher-risk geographies. Account access patterns, contact information, and beneficiary details stored in Interact remained consistent before and after death, suggesting no unauthorized usage.

3. Absence of Structuring Indicators:

    Each cash deposit represents a distinct and reasonable tranche of cash associated with estate liquidations. No intentional splitting below the CTR threshold is evident from same-day or otherwise suspicious patterns.
    Historical compliance is verified through prior CTR filings ([CTR-file-# or "None to date"]), and continued monitoring has not revealed deviation from standard estate management practices.

Aggregate Activity (02 Mar – 22 Mar 2025):

 Total Cash Credits: $36,100
 Total Estate Expenses: $[Estate-expense-subtotal]
 Total Beneficiary Gifts: $[Beneficiary-gift-total]

Conclusion and Recommendation:
Based on the comprehensive investigation, which included an assessment of transaction patterns, beneficiary distribution consistency, geographic logic, and available estate documentation, the alerted activities do not appear suspicious. They clearly align with legitimate estate settlement processes. Therefore, the March 2025 Large Cash Deposit and Cash Structuring alerts are recommended to be closed as “Not Suspicious – Estate Administration.”

Continued routine monitoring is advised through the completion of probate activities. Escalation for SAR filing would be necessary only if subsequent account activities deviate from established estate-related patterns or involve unauthorized parties.
