The structured cash deposits made on 11–12 March 2025 totaled $10,035, triggering the structured deposit alert. This was the only sub-48-hour period during the six-month review where cash deposits collectively exceeded the $10,000 reporting threshold. All other deposits occurred individually, separated by intervals of at least four days, indicating no ongoing structuring pattern.

Although the review period includes thirteen large cash deposits totaling approximately $47,000, these transactions are not egregious in terms of frequency or size. Each deposit remained well below the $10,000 threshold, occurred sporadically, and appeared aligned with regular, routine financial activities. Furthermore, these cash deposits primarily funded consistent outflows via ACH payments, demonstrating ordinary financial activity rather than suspicious accumulation or rapid cycling of funds.

Outflows were predominantly ACH-driven, including significant recurring payments to known creditors, such as $5,000 paid to American Express on 18-Mar-2025 and another $5,000 payment on 20-Jun-2025. These transactions illustrate routine personal expenditures rather than irregular or unexplained payments.

Additional inflows to the account include an ACH payroll deposit of $779 from AGCO on 28-Feb-2025, as well as a check deposit for $3,100 annotated with “rent” on 09-Jun-2025. These legitimate and documented sources further illustrate ordinary personal financial management.

Across all reviewed activity, no indicators of suspicious financial behavior—such as repeated structuring cycles or dealings with unfamiliar or high-risk counterparties—were identified. The transactions collectively reflect ordinary and legitimate personal cash management.
