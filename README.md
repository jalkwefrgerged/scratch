The following alerts were triggered by account activity:
- Cash-and-wire velocity alert — cash deposits greater than $25,000 followed by comparable wires inside 30 days.
- Cash structuring proximity alert — several cash deposits less $10,000 posted within consecutive days that together exceed $10,000.

The specific transactions causing those alerts were:
- 11-Mar-2025 — $20,000 outgoing wire to Rezzy Motorsports
- 14-Mar-2025 — $10,230 outgoing wire to Rezzy Motorsports
- 17-Mar-2025 — $6,300 cash deposit at financial center in Jacksonville, FT

Open source research reveals that Anderson Veloso Moreira controls two Florida entities at 12114 Irwin Manor Dr, Jacksonville: Pro Outdoor Solutions Corp (google query reveals hit for company website with same address as Moreira and indicates that services provided include outdoor remodeling per ) and Moreira Professional Services Corp (open source research could not confirm that exact nature of this business). Payroll checks from the latter are routinely deposited, reflecting owner compensation.


Cash activity totals $28,100 across five single-lump deposits. There is only a sinlge instance of sub-48 hour deposits which aggregate to above the reproting threshold: the $6,300 on 17-Mar and $6,000 on 19-Mar—did. No similar sub-48hr clusters are present during the review period. Mid-March marks peak outdoor-remodeling season in Florida, when multiple projects close and clients can potentially pay on site in the form of cash. Overall, there is not a clear pattern indicating Moreira is intentionally structuring deposits to avoid regulatory filings. 

The wires of $20,000 and $10,230, sent three days apart, were directed to Rezzy Motorsports, an established domestic powersports dealer (). A two-part payment schedule fits purchase of a utility/ATV vehicle useful for outdoor remodeling work.

A sampling on inflows and outflows further supports a picture of regular business operations and non-suspicous activity,
- 08-Apr-2025 — $6,500 check labeled “pool paid in full,” evidencing pool-remodel revenue.
- Regular payroll checks from Moreira Professional Services Corp, e.g., $1,276 deposited 11-Mar-2025.
- Teller transfers to established domestic counterparties such Top Cars Auto Group. As a client of Bank of America customer, Top cars Auto Group is listed as an automotive dealer and open source research reveals an active businesss regression with the state of Florida (). As an established car sales entity, this counterparty does not pose high-risk characteristics.


Taken together, the cash deposits, related-party payroll, pool-remodel check, equipment wires, and routine transfers to known merchants reflect ordinary seasonal revenue and legitimate business expenditures for a cash-intensive outdoor-remodeling enterprise and do not raise reasonable suspicion of money laundering or structuring.
