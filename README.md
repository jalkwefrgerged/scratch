Bank monitoring raised five categories of alerts regarding activities associated with Why Not Coffee Importers Corp. and its owner, Iliana Delgado Chegwin: large outgoing wires, abnormal online Next-Day/Three-Day ACH activity, a brief spike in Laser Draft usage, modest international ACH inflows, and a single large ATM cash deposit. The following paragraphs detail why each of these alerts, when reviewed in context, does not rise to a level of suspicion.

Why Not Coffee Importers Corp., founded in 2021, is a privately held importer of green coffee beans, regularly sourcing unroasted coffee from established Colombian suppliers and selling them to specialty roasters across the United States. Extensive open-source research covering corporate records, customs data, sanctions lists, and adverse media databases revealed no negative press, sanctions hits, or regulatory issues involving either the company or its owner. This thoroughly vetted and legitimate business profile effectively mitigates concerns raised by the monitoring alerts.

The ATM large cash deposit alert involved a single ATM cash deposit of $5,500 on 19 May 2025. Upon review, this deposit aligns with typical operating expenses for a small business owner, with no subsequent pattern of cash deposits detected, thereby affirming its non-suspicious nature.

Abnormal online Next-Day/Three-Day ACH activity was detected, characterized by rapid account balance turnover, multiple international log-ins, and various round-amount credits. Examination revealed these transactions align clearly with legitimate business activities. For instance, ACH credits such as $10,889 from ThatCoffee LLC on 30 April 2025 and $4,883 via Intuit labeled "KoffeeKult" on 13 February 2025 are consistent with routine domestic sales receipts, replenishing working capital for ongoing import operations.

The abnormal online Laser Draft activity alert related to a single $1,000 debit payment made on 24 December 2024 to American Express. This payment was reviewed and identified as a standard business expense. No additional irregular Laser Draft transactions followed, confirming its routine nature and absence of suspicious characteristics.

Large outgoing wire transaction alerts arose between mid-November 2024 and February 2025, involving approximately thirty wire transfers totaling $430,000–$490,000. These outgoing wires were directed to reputable Colombian coffee exporters, exemplified by a $28,853 transfer to Exportadora de Café Isabel on 29 January 2025, aligning with documented coffee shipment records. Counterparties successfully passed sanctions and adverse-media screening, and transaction volumes matched normal inventory procurement needs.

The international ACH transaction alerts involved seven modest international ACH credits (each below $1,900) received from Colombian senders between December 2024 and March 2025. Examples include a $350 transfer from Natalie Delgado on 31 December 2024 and a $153 transfer from Nancy Delgado on 19 February 2025. Given the matching surname, these transactions likely represent routine family support or minor personal-related payments, rather than suspicious activities.

A review of typical domestic transactions further reinforces the routine nature of the account’s operations. Revenue deposits include a $5,834 check from Euphoria Coffee Roasters on 24 January 2025 and an ACH from Sonder Coffee on 31 December 2024. Routine business expenses consist of a $473 check to Customs Brokerage Inc. on 27 January 2025 for freight services and a $100 peer-to-peer payment to RGM Accounting Services on 3 December 2024 covering standard regulatory filings.

Overall, observed funds flows—domestic revenues briefly retained and subsequently disbursed to international suppliers and domestic vendors—align precisely with expected financial operations of an importing business. No unexplained counterparties, unusual patterns, or evidence of structuring, layering, or sanctions evasion emerged. Continued routine monitoring remains appropriate, given the moderate inherent risk associated with cross-border commodity trade and single-owner governance.
