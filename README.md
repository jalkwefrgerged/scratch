Public listings show that B&J Petroleum Sales LLC operates an ARCO / ampm gas station and convenience store at 6375 N Blackstone Ave, Fresno—a classic cash-intensive retail format. In such operations, everyday sales of fuel, snacks, lottery tickets, and other impulse items generate a high volume of low-value cash transactions, so frequent, sizeable bank deposits are an ordinary feature of the business type.

A review of the customer’s cash-deposit history shows no evidence of a deliberate attempt to systmeically structure large deposits in order to avoid regualtory filings. Instead, their behavior consistently demonstrates a willingness to transact well above the $10,000 Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold, almost always in person and at the same branch—7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720. Representative examples include:

- 06 / 12 / 2025 – $11,887 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)
- 06 / 09 / 2025 – $12,084 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)
- 06 / 06 / 2025 – $10,626 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)
- 05 / 28 / 2025 – $37,713 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)
- 04 / 16 / 2025 – $14,131 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)


These deposits illustrate several key mitigating factors. Amounts are well above the CTR trigger. The customer does not attempt to keep cash deposits under $10,000; instead, they routinely exceed it in single, straightforward transactions. All listed deposits—and many others—were completed in person, showing no attempt to avoid branch scrutiny. Customer makes consistent use of a single-branch. Making large deposits at the same Fresno location negates any notion of “bank shopping” or dispersing funds across multiple branches or institutions. The instances where cash deposits happened to aggreate to above the regualtory threshold within a short time frame are likley the accumilaiton of weekly cash recipts which were deposited in multiple runs. Moreover, January 3, 2025, immediately followed a federal holiday, suggesting that the deposits flagged for structuring during this timeframe likely represent accumulations resulting from banking inactivity over the holiday period. 

Beyond the previously discussed large cash deposits, the everyday inflows and outflows in this account reflect the cadence of an ordinary cash-intensive retail business. On May 6 2025, the customer received two modest ACH credits—$60 and $50—from California Lottery Scratchers, while mid-tier cash deposits of $14,000 on April 16 2025 and $3,702 on April 14 2025 represent typical store receipts being banked after a day’s sales.

Outbound activity echoes the same legitimate business pattern. An ACH debit of $34,718 on April 17 2025 was sent to Marathon Petrol; open-source checks confirm Marathon Petroleum is a wholesale fuel supplier, so the payment plausibly covers inventory purchases. Likewise, a $1,010 payroll check dated April 7 2025 shows routine employee compensation.

In combination, these credits and debits illustrate a straightforward flow of funds: cash and small lottery ACH receipts enter the account from daily retail operations, while larger ACH debits and payroll checks leave to recognized vendors and staff. There is no sign of circular transfers, layering, or attempts to disguise funds—further mitigating any suspicion of illicit or structured activity.


Taken together, the customer’s high-value, in-person, single-branch deposits strongly counter the allegation of structuring; their activity aligns with normal, transparent cash handling rather than an effort to conceal or fragment cash transactions.
