Public listings show that B&J Petroleum Sales LLC operates an ARCO / ampm gas station and convenience store at 6375 N Blackstone Ave, Fresno—a classic cash-intensive retail format. In such operations, everyday sales of fuel, snacks, lottery tickets, and other impulse items generate a high volume of low-value cash transactions, so frequent, sizeable bank deposits are an ordinary feature of the business type.

A review of the customer’s cash-deposit history shows no evidence of a deliberate attempt to systmeically structure large deposits in order to avoid regualtory filings. Instead, their behavior consistently demonstrates a willingness to transact well above the $10,000 Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold, always in person and almost exclusively at the same branch—7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720. Representative examples include:

- 06 / 12 / 2025 – $11,887 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)
- 06 / 09 / 2025 – $12,084 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)
- 06 / 06 / 2025 – $10,626 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)
- 05 / 28 / 2025 – $37,713 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)
- 04 / 16 / 2025 – $14,131 (deposit at financial center located at 7837 North Blackstone Avenue, Fresno, CA 93720)


These deposits illustrate several key mitigating factors. Amounts are well above the CTR trigger. The customer does not attempt to keep cash deposits under $10,000; instead, they routinely exceed it in single, straightforward transactions. All listed deposits—and many others—were completed in person, showing no attempt to avoid branch scrutiny. Customer uses a consistent single-branch usage. Making large deposits at the same Fresno location negates any notion of “bank shopping” or dispersing funds across multiple branches or institutions. The instances where cash deposits happened to aggreate to above the regualtory threshold within a short time frame are likley the accumilaiton of weekly cash recipts which were deposited in multiple runs. Moreover, January 3, 2025, immediately followed a federal holiday, suggesting that the deposits flagged for structuring during this timeframe likely represent accumulations resulting from banking inactivity over the holiday period. 


Taken together, the customer’s high-value, in-person, single-branch deposits strongly counter the allegation of structuring; their activity aligns with normal, transparent cash handling rather than an effort to conceal or fragment cash transactions.
