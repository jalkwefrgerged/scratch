An investigation has been completed, and a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) will be filed for suspected structuring.

Alert-triggering cash deposits

• 3 March 2025: $9,000 cash deposit at the Bank of America financial center, 30 South Orleans Road, Orleans, Massachusetts.
• 7 March 2025: $9,000 cash deposit at the same Orleans, Massachusetts location.
• 17 March 2025: $9,100 cash deposit at the Bank of America financial center, 9680 Grant Street, Thornton, Colorado.
• 19 March 2025: $9,000 cash deposit at the same Thornton, Colorado location.

Why the deposits are suspicious and indicative of structuring

The cash deposits involved were consistently structured in round-dollar amounts, deliberately set just below the $10,000 Currency Transaction Report (CTR) threshold. Each deposit ranged narrowly between $9,000 and $9,100—a recognized tactic employed to evade regulatory reporting requirements. Reinforcing this suspicion, deposits appeared in pairs at each branch rather than as single larger transactions, indicating intentional splitting of larger cash sums into multiple sub-threshold amounts.

Further compounding the suspicion, deposit activity exhibited rapid geographic shifts that lack any documented legitimate business rationale. Within approximately ten days, the cash deposits transitioned from a branch near the decedent’s known residence in Massachusetts to a branch nearly 2,000 miles away in Thornton, Colorado. Open-source research identified Robert “Rob” Sieban as residing near this Thornton branch. Sieban is an executive associated with United Flea Markets LLC, a cash-intensive business. However, given Sieban’s executive role, such substantial, structured personal cash inflows appear unusual and inconsistent with his known profile.

Additionally, two further cash deposits made at the Thornton, Colorado branch—$8,000 on 12 March 2025 and $9,265 on 26 March 2025—though not initially triggering automated alerts, reflect the same structured, sub-threshold deposit pattern. Their existence confirms the deliberate ongoing nature of splitting cash deposits.

Finally, the method and timing of these deposits do not align with typical estate-settlement practices. Cash associated with legitimate estate proceedings is typically deposited at once near the decedent’s primary location or shortly thereafter. In this instance, however, deposits were inexplicably spread over three weeks and two distant states. Moreover, tax-free gift disbursements to beneficiaries, such as the $8,000 check to Tyler Sullivan Prado dated 27 January 2025, were made before the structured cash deposits, demonstrating that these cash deposits were not necessary to fund beneficiary payments.

Collectively, the deliberate structuring of near-threshold cash amounts, repeated splitting, unexplained geographic shifts, Sieban’s unusual profile for cash transactions, additional non-alerting structured deposits, and inconsistency with normal estate practices strongly indicate deliberate structuring activity intended to evade regulatory reporting. Thus, a SAR submission is warranted.

Sampling of inflows and outflows

Inflows into the account consisted primarily of structured cash deposits such as the $9,000 credit on 3 March 2025, alongside non-cash credits including a brokerage transfer of $16,000 on 14 January 2025.

Outflows included estate-related payments and other expenditures. Notable examples are an $8,000 check dated 27 January 2025 payable to beneficiary Tyler Sullivan Prado (memo: "Tax-free gift"), and a bill-pay debit transaction of $8,723 processed on 3 February 2025. These examples demonstrate legitimate disbursements occurred prior to or independently of the structured cash deposits, further supporting the conclusion that the cash deposits were structured without any connection to documented legitimate account activity.
