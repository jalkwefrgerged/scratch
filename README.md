Bank monitoring flagged three categories of cash-related activity during 2025: Structured Cash Deposits, Large Cash Deposits (including ATM deposits), and associated Cash-In/Wire-Out transactions.

The structured cash-deposit alert was triggered by two deposits made on consecutive business days at the same Bank of America financial-center ATM (3120 W Grant Line Rd, Tracy, CA):
	-	30-Apr-2025 — cash deposit $4,050
	-	01-May-2025 — cash deposit $8,000

These deposits represent a single occurrence with no similar sub-48-hour patterns elsewhere in the customer’s history. The transactions occurred at the same location within normal business hours, indicating customer convenience rather than efforts to evade reporting thresholds or conceal funds.

Separately, large-cash-deposit alerts were triggered by the following transactions:
	-	27-Jan-2025 — cash deposit $5,500
	-	18-Mar-2025 — cash deposit $5,000
	-	30-Apr-2025 — cash deposit $4,050
	-	01-May-2025 — cash deposit $8,000
	-	18-Jun-2025 — cash deposit $11,000

These deposits total $33,550 over approximately six months, a moderate and reasonable sum. They primarily funded outgoing wires that separately triggered the Cash-In/Wire-Out alert:
	-	11-Jun-2025 — wire $8,300 to Dongguan Hanyu Apparel
	-	20-Jun-2025 — wire $11,000 to Dongguan Hanyu Apparel

Open-source research revealed that the customer is the registered agent for emmy.boutique LLC, located at the customer’s address. Given the business’s name, it likely sells clothing, supporting the legitimacy of wires sent to Dongguan Hanyu Apparel in Hong Kong, a non-high-risk jurisdiction, as ordinary inventory purchases. The timing and amounts of the cash deposits align closely with these wires, demonstrating a direct flow of funds from deposits to a known business counterparty.

A sampling of additional inflows and outflows further illustrates the nonsuspicious nature of account activity. The customer repeatedly receives ACH payroll deposits, notably recurring child support payments of $284, such as on 13-Jun-2025. They also receive ACH credits from Square Inc., including $1,300 and $41 on 17-Mar-2025, consistent with small business transactions. Outflows primarily include routine wires such as the $8,300 wire to Dongguan Hanyu Apparel noted above, along with regular online banking debit card payments, such as $103 on 18-May-2025.

Across all reviewed activity, there are no indicators of suspicious financial behaviors such as repeated structuring patterns, rapid cycling, layering, concealment attempts, or transfers involving unfamiliar or high-risk counterparties. The documented transactions collectively reflect ordinary, legitimate personal and business cash management.
