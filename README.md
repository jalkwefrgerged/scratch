**Overview of Alerts:**
During March 2025, multiple alerts were generated for suspicious cash transactions involving large withdrawals and deposits consistent with deliberate structuring intended to circumvent currency transaction reporting requirements.

**Transactions Causing Alerts:**

* **March 18, 2025:** Cash withdrawal of $10,000
* **March 19, 2025:** Cash withdrawal of $7,000
* **March 5, 2025:** Cash deposit of $10,000
* **March 10, 2025:** Cash deposit of $10,000

**Narrative Summary:**
The alerts initially triggered due to significant cash withdrawals on March 18 and March 19, 2025. These two withdrawals, $10,000 on March 18 and $7,000 on March 19, occurred within a sub-48-hour period and collectively totaled $17,000—well exceeding the $10,000 regulatory threshold requiring Currency Transaction Reports. Structuring withdrawals across consecutive days to stay below reporting thresholds while moving substantial amounts of cash is a recognized tactic deliberately employed to evade mandatory reporting obligations.

Upon further analysis, the pattern indicative of structuring is strongly supported by earlier cash deposit activity. Specifically, cash deposits were made on March 5 and March 10, each exactly totaling $10,000—precisely the amount at which Currency Transaction Reports must be filed. Conducting multiple deposits at exactly the $10,000 threshold within a short time frame significantly raises suspicion, as legitimate financial activity rarely aligns repeatedly and precisely with regulatory thresholds.

Additionally, detailed review revealed both $10,000 deposits were executed during daytime hours exclusively at ATMs (1055 Calimesa Blvd., Calimesa, CA 92320), potentially indicating a deliberate attempt by the subject to avoid face-to-face interactions with bank personnel, further minimizing the risk of scrutiny or inquiry. Specifically, the March 5 deposit was conducted through three simultaneous transactions at exactly 3:07 PM, while the March 10 deposit was made through two simultaneous transactions at exactly 2:16 PM. These simultaneous deposits likely reflect ATM-imposed currency limitations; nevertheless, the precise aggregate amounts strongly indicate intentional structuring.

Further reinforcing suspicions of structuring is the absence of any legitimate financial justification for these substantial cash transactions. Open-source research and internal employment documentation identify one subject as a laborer at Splash Kingdom and another as a homemaker—occupations that typically do not involve significant or frequent cash-based financial activity. The lack of identifiable cash-intensive business activities or credible alternative sources of funds further supports the conclusion that these transactions were deliberately structured to evade regulatory reporting requirements.
