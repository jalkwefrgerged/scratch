An internal investigation was completed regarding cash deposit activity on the customer’s account, specifically addressing structuring alerts and unusual transactional alerts involving large ATM cash deposits. After careful review, no Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) will be filed, as the reviewed transactions did not reflect structuring or suspicious activity.

Two categories of alerts were reviewed:

1. Structuring Alerts: Triggered by three cash deposits at a single ATM in Port Charlotte, Florida, on March 4, 2025:

   - $4,980 and $620 deposited with the same timestamp at 11:08 AM (likely due to ATM currency limits)
   - $5,000 at 11:11 AM
   - $5,100 at 11:14 AM

   These deposits occurred within six minutes at the same ATM. The splitting of the initial deposit ($5,600 total) into two separate transactions sharing an identical timestamp is likely due to ATM currency or deposit constraints rather than an attempt to evade reporting requirements. The rapid succession and single location strongly suggest convenience rather than structuring intent. Additionally, this event represents the only occasion within the review period where cash deposits aggregated to a significant amount over a short time. No similar structuring-like patterns were observed elsewhere in the account.

   Further mitigating any concerns, these deposits directly funded checks payable to individuals whose last names match the trust associated with the account, clearly indicating legitimate trust disbursements. Examples include:

   - $2,000 payable to Dale Terzign on March 17, 2025
   - $1,000 payable to Paula Terzign on March 17, 2025

2. Unusual Large Cash Deposit Alerts: Triggered by two ATM deposits on January 27, 2025:

   - $4,000
   - $3,000

   These deposits, while notable, are moderate in amount and frequency, and therefore are not considered excessive. They may potentially represent deposits of estate-related cash or other legitimate cash sources. The deposits exhibit no patterns of irregular or suspicious behavior, nor do they significantly deviate from the customer’s typical account activity.

To further support the legitimacy and non-suspicious nature of the account’s activity, typical inflows and outflows were reviewed:

Typical Inflows:

- ACH deposit from Social Security of $3,046 on March 26, 2025.
- Regular Zelle payments from repeated individuals, such as Nathalie Phil:

  - $150 on May 27, 2025
  - $60 on March 27, 2025

Typical Outflows:

- ACH transactions, including credit card payments such as American Express for $33 on April 15, 2025.
- Checks payable to trust beneficiaries, including:

  - $1,000 payable to Paula Terzign on February 10, 2025.

Based on this comprehensive review—including the clearly legitimate use of funds, routine transactional patterns, and lack of other suspicious activity indicators—no Suspicious Activity Report is warranted.
